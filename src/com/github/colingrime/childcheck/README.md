## Child Check
Dr. Oroojiâ€™s twins (Mack and Zack) play soccer. We will assume Mack wears
jersey number 18 and Zack wears 17. So, Dr. O has to look for these two numbers
when trying to find the twins. Given a list of 10 jersey numbers, determine if 
the twins are in the group of players on the field.

[**Input**] The first input line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number
of data sets to check. The sets are on the following n input lines, one set per
line. Each set consists of exactly 10 single-space-separated distinct integers (each
integer between 11 and 99 inclusive) giving the jersey numbers for the players.

[**Output**] Print each input set. Then, on the next output line, print one of four
messages: mack, zack, both, or none to indicate how many of the twins are in
the set. Leave a blank line after the output for each test case.
